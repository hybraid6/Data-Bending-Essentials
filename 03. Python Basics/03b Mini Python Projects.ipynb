    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Define Constants**:\n",
    "   - `MAX_AGE` is set to 90 years, which is the assumed lifespan.\n",
    "   - `DAYS_IN_YEAR`, `WEEKS_IN_YEAR`, and `MONTHS_IN_YEAR` are set to 365, 52, and 12 respectively, representing the number of days, weeks, and months in a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Take User Input**:\n",
    "   - The program prompts the user to input their current age using `input()`. The `int()` function converts the input from a string to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Remaining Time**:\n",
    "   - `years_left` is calculated by subtracting the user's current age from `MAX_AGE`.\n",
    "   - `days_left`, `weeks_left`, and `months_left` are then calculated by multiplying `years_left` by the number of days, weeks, and months in a year, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output the Result**:\n",
    "   - The program uses an f-String to format and print the calculated days, weeks, and months left.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "If the user enters their age as `56`:\n",
    "- `years_left` will be `90 - 56 = 34`\n",
    "- `days_left` will be `34 * 365 = 12410`\n",
    "- `weeks_left` will be `34 * 52 = 1768`\n",
    "- `months_left` will be `34 * 12 = 408`\n"

    "2. **Input for City**:\n",
    "   - The program prompts the user to enter the name of the city they grew up in.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Input for Pet's Name**:\n",

    "   - Again, the `\\n` ensures the input cursor appears on a new line.\n",

    "   - The program combines the city and pet names with a space in between to form the band name.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **User Input**:\n",
    "   - The program prompts the user to enter a 2-digit number using the `input()` function. This input is stored as a string in the variable `two_digit_number`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extracting Digits**:\n",
    "   - Since `two_digit_number` is a string, we can use subscripting (indexing) to extract individual characters.\n",
    "   - `first_digit = two_digit_number[0]` gets the first character (the first digit).\n",
    "   - `second_digit = two_digit_number[1]` gets the second character (the second digit).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Type Conversion**:\n",
    "   - The characters representing digits are converted to integers using the `int()` function.\n",
    "   - This allows us to perform arithmetic operations on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adding the Digits**:\n",
    "   - The program adds the two integers and stores the result in the variable `digit_sum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output the Result**:\n",
    "   - The program prints the result in the required format using an f-String.\n",

    "Enter a 2-digit number: 39\n",
