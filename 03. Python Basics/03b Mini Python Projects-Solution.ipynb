    "1. **Creating a Variable**:\n",
    "   - We create a variable named `number` and assign it an integer value. You can change this value to test with different numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Checking Even or Odd**:\n",
    "   - We use the modulo operator `%` to determine if `number` is even or odd.\n",
    "   - If `number % 2 == 0`, the number is even because it is divisible by 2 with no remainder.\n",
    "   - If not, the number is odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Checking Divisibility by 2 and Greater than 10**:\n",
    "   - We use the logical operator `and` to check if `number` is both divisible by 2 (`number % 2 == 0`) and greater than 10 (`number > 10`).\n",
    "   - Both conditions must be true for the statement to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Checking Divisibility by 2 or Greater than 10**:\n",
    "   - We use the logical operator `or` to check if `number` is either divisible by 2 (`number % 2 == 0`) or greater than 10 (`number > 10`).\n",
    "   - Only one of the conditions needs to be true for the statement to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will print messages based on the checks performed for the value of `number`."

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Define Constants**:\n",
    "   - `MAX_AGE` is set to 90 years, which is the assumed lifespan.\n",
    "   - `DAYS_IN_YEAR`, `WEEKS_IN_YEAR`, and `MONTHS_IN_YEAR` are set to 365, 52, and 12 respectively, representing the number of days, weeks, and months in a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Take User Input**:\n",
    "   - The program prompts the user to input their current age using `input()`. The `int()` function converts the input from a string to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Remaining Time**:\n",
    "   - `years_left` is calculated by subtracting the user's current age from `MAX_AGE`.\n",
    "   - `days_left`, `weeks_left`, and `months_left` are then calculated by multiplying `years_left` by the number of days, weeks, and months in a year, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output the Result**:\n",
    "   - The program uses an f-String to format and print the calculated days, weeks, and months left.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "If the user enters their age as `56`:\n",
    "- `years_left` will be `90 - 56 = 34`\n",
    "- `days_left` will be `34 * 365 = 12410`\n",
    "- `weeks_left` will be `34 * 52 = 1768`\n",
    "- `months_left` will be `34 * 12 = 408`\n"

    "2. **Extracting Digits**:\n",
    "   - Since `two_digit_number` is a string, we can use subscripting (indexing) to extract individual characters.\n",
