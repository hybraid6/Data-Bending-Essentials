    "#### Instructions\n",
    "1. **Create a new file called `text_processor.py`**.\n",
    "2. **Create a class called `TextProcessor` that contains the following**:\n",
    "    - A dictionary attribute to store the available text operations and their corresponding functions.\n",
    "    - A method called `__init__` that initializes the dictionary with basic text operations (count words, reverse text) and their corresponding functions.\n",
    "    - A method called `add_operation` that takes in two arguments: the operation name and the corresponding function. This method should add the new operation and function to the dictionary.\n",
    "    - A method called `process` that takes in two arguments: the text and the operation name. This method should use the dictionary to determine the appropriate function to perform the text operation. It should also include error handling to check if the operation name is valid. If an error is encountered, the method should print an error message and raise an exception.\n",
    "3. **Create separate functions for advanced text operations (convert to uppercase, convert to lowercase, find substring) and use the `add_operation` method to add them to the text processor's dictionary**.\n",
    "4. **In the main program, create an instance of the `TextProcessor` class, and use a while loop that allows the user to continue performing text operations until they choose to exit**.\n",
    "5. **Use the `input()` function to get input from the user for the text and operation name**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Operations:\n",
    "- **Count Words**: Counts the number of words in the text.\n",
    "- **Reverse Text**: Reverses the entire text.\n",
    "- **Convert to Uppercase**: Converts all characters in the text to uppercase.\n",
    "- **Convert to Lowercase**: Converts all characters in the text to lowercase.\n",
    "- **Find Substring**: Finds the position of a substring in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enter the text: Hello World\n",
    "- Enter the operation (count, reverse, upper, lower, find): upper\n",
    "- The result is: HELLO WORLD"

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class `TextProcessor`**:\n",
    "    - The `__init__` method initializes the dictionary `operations` with basic text operations.\n",
    "    - The `add_operation` method allows adding new operations to the dictionary.\n",
    "    - The `process` method performs the text operation by looking up the operation in the dictionary and handling errors.\n",
    "    - Basic text operation methods (`count_words`, `reverse_text`, `to_uppercase`, `to_lowercase`, `find_substring`) are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Operations**:\n",
    "    - `to_uppercase` converts all characters in the text to uppercase.\n",
    "    - `to_lowercase` converts all characters in the text to lowercase.\n",
    "    - `find_substring` finds the position of a substring in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Program**:\n",
    "    - An instance of `TextProcessor` is created.\n",
    "    - A `while` loop allows the user to perform multiple text operations until they type 'exit'.\n",
    "    - The program prompts the user for input, performs the text operation, and handles any errors that occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "    - The `process` method checks for valid operations.\n",
    "    - Errors are caught and appropriate error messages are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation ensures that the text processor is flexible, user-friendly, and robust against invalid inputs and operations.\n",
